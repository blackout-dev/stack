# BLACKOUT stack

Run the BLACKOUT stack with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

This stores example environment files and a Docker Compose configuration.

## Contributing

Contributors should keep the example environment files up-to-date.
This can be done automatically using the `env-examples` script.

```sh
yarn build
yarn env-examples
```
